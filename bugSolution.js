To solve the issue, you need to ensure that the native modules are correctly linked to your project. This usually involves running the library's post-installation scripts, such as `react-native link` or running pod install in the ios folder.  You may also need to clean your build folders (sometimes rebuilding the project isn't enough to resolve linking issues).

Here's an example using react-native-camera:

1. **Ensure correct installation:** Make sure that you have followed all the installation instructions for the library.
2. **Run Linking Scripts:** If the library provides linking scripts, run them. This often involves `react-native link <library-name>`.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Clean your build folders. This might be done differently for Android and iOS. For Android, you can delete the `build` folder in the android folder.  For iOS, you can run `rm -rf $TMPDIR/react-*` and sometimes also delete the `build` folder in the ios folder.
4. **Check Native Dependencies (if needed):** Some libraries need specific native dependencies to be installed. Check the library's documentation to ensure you meet these requirements.
5. **Check Version Compatibility:** Make sure there are no version mismatches between the library, React Native and your native platform dependencies.
6. **Restart your packager:** After doing the above steps, restart your packager (and re-run your project) for the changes to take effect.

If the error persists, check the library's issue tracker or support forums for possible solutions specific to that library.
